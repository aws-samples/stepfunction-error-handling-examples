## Handling Errors, Retries, and adding Alerting to Step Function State Machine Executions
Purpose
AWS Step Functions allow you to coordinate and stitch together multiple AWS Services into a serverless workflow. Step Function State Machines are created through the use of Amazon States Language (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html) - a JSON-based configuration. Complex workflows are made simple and completely managed through the use of AWS Step Functions.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a highly-durable, scalable, secure, and fully-managed Pub/Sub messaging service. It helps to de-couple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Amazon SNS directly integrates with various other AWS services, in particular, it can be directly integrated with CloudWatch Events to send notifications to various subscribers.
